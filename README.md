# FlightPerformance
An analysis of __flight performance__ for typical airliners at different altitudes and at different values of BPR (*bypass ratio*).\
In the following plots, you can find these performance coefficients:
- TSFC --> Thrust Specific Fuel Consumption
- I --> Specific Thrust
- &eta;<sub>th</sub> --> Thermodynamic Cycle Efficiency
- &eta;<sub>p</sub> --> Propulsive Efficiency
- &eta;<sub>o</sub> --> Overall Propulsion Efficiency\
